# To-Do-App2.0
1. This application is used to save the list of tasks you want to accomplish. The app is made using Rest API and Retrofit and the tasks are stored in the servers. 
2. You can retrieve your tasks on any device by just using your log in credentials.
3. The edit task feature works on right swiping the task. The delete task feature works on left swiping the task. Use the search icon on the top right to search for a particular task and edit or delete it. 
4. The app uses the internal storage of your device just to store the login credentials and enable the “Keep me logged in” feature so that you don’t have to log in every time to check your remaining tasks. 
5. Also, there is a profile icon on the top right corner which helps you see your profile and log out.
